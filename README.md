# Swag library
Swag is a low-level library for writing http servers in python. 
It has no dependencies other than Python and its standard library.
The library uses sockets under the hood and is synchronous.

## Swag roadmap:
- docs
- tests
- path query like ?value=69

The documentation needs to create a section for in-depth and superficial, right now there is only half superficial, which is sad.

We need to write various tests for CI&CD.

We also need refactor code and comment some moments in it.
